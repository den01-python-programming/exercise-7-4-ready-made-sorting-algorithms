# Exercise 7.4 Ready Made Sorting Algorithms

Add the following methods to the main program:

- `def sort_integers(self, integers)` that sorts a list of integers.

- `def sort_strings(self, strings)` that sorts a list of strings into alphabetical order.

Be sure to use the ready-made Python libraries in your implementation.
